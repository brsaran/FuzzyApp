<p />
Currently, there are four different versions of the FASTA programs
that can be downloaded from
the <a href="http://faculty.virginia.edu/wrpearson/fasta">FASTA
Software WWW site</a>.  I recommend that you use
either <a href="fasta36/">fasta-36</a>, the current version (since
2010), or <a href="fasta3/">fasta-35</a>, the "classic" version that
has been available for since 2007.
<p />
Here I try to explain the major differences.

<tr><th>Version</th><th>New Programs</th><th>Other changes</th></tr>

<td><a href="fasta36/">fasta-36</a></td><td> None </td><td>
The major improvement in FASTA v36 is the ability to calculate and
display multiple significant alignments (multiple HSP's) between a
query sequence and a library sequence.  Previous FASTA versions had
the serious shortcoming of only showing the best
alignment. A <tt>tfastx36</tt> alignment between a protein and its
exon-containing gene will show all of the exon alignments that are
long enough to be significant.
<p>
FASTA v36 also provides more flexible strategies for searching lists
of database files, and versions after fasta-36.2 are fully threaded, so
both searches and alignments can be distributed among multiple
processors with efficient speedup.
<p>
In addition, current versions of the FASTA36 programs provide the
option of searching against a smaller, representative database but
presenting results using a linked expanded database using the <tt>-e
script</tt> option.  This option can be used to search smaller
representative databases in metagenomics searches, or to search a
standard set of human proteins, but provide alignments against a set
that includes alternative isoforms.

</td>
<td>FASTA v35 provides significant improvements in statistical accuracy and program efficiency in threaded (multi-CPU, multi-core) environments. The program now automatically produces 500 random shuffles when small libraries are searched.  Thus, <code>prss</code> and <code>prfx</code> are no longer required; <code>ssearch35</code> and <code>fastx35</code> provide the same function.</td>

</td>
<td>FASTA v34 is the last version of the FASTA3 series before the
  significant changes introduced with FASTA v35.  The FASTA v3
  programs were first introduced in 1996, with threaded code
  for multi-processors, more accurate statistical estimates, and
  optimal Smith-Waterman alignments with <code>ssearch</code>.  More
  recent versions (v34) provided accelerated Smith-Waterman searches
  using Altivec and SSE2 vector processors. FASTA v34 is no longer
  updated for bug fixes. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan=3><hr /></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="fasta2/">fasta2</a></td>
<td><code>+lfasta</code><br /><code>+tfasta</code>
</td>
<td>FASTA v2 was introduced in 1995, improving sensitivity by
  calculated gapped alignment scores. Modern (V34 and V35) versions of
  FASTA have significantly more robust statistical estimates, threaded
  code, and vectorized Smith-Waterman, so FASTA v2 should not be used
  for database searching.  However, until <code>lalign</code> was addeed
  to FASTA v35 in March, 2007, FASTA v2 was the only source for
  the <code>lalign</code> program.  Today, the only programs provided in
  FASTA v2 that are not provided in FASTA v35 are the Kyte-Doolittle
  hydropathy plotter <code>grease</code> and the classic (though very
  inaccurate) secondary structure prediction programs <code>chofas</code>
  and <code>garnier</code></td>

<p />
The current stable version of the FASTA programs is version 36.
In addition, the older version 35 is <a href="fasta3/">available</a>
to make it easier for software packagers to work with a consistent
version of the software.  However,
the <a href="CURRENT/">CURRENT</a>
version of FASTA should be used whenever possible.  Many bug reports
reflect older versions of the software.
